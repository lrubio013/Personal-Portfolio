# Personal Portfolio


## Objective
I created my first ever personal portfolio to allow me to easily show my accomplishments in coding to my peers and potential employers.

## What I learned
I learned how important a professional portfolio can be in the tech world. It's a convenient way to keep track of you're information, accomplishmets and ways to contact you. It's also great how there are unlimited ways to style a portfolio and truly make it a representation of who you are as a person. I can't wait to come back to my portfolio in the future with new experiences and skillsets that'll allow me to vastly improve and expand on my portfolio!
